## 👩‍🏫 What This Project Teaches

- Move vs Copy semantics  
- Clone vs shallow copy  
- How ownership affects variable validity  
- Borrowing (`&`) and mutable borrowing (`&mut`)  
- Slices in strings and arrays  
- Shadowing and scope  
- Data safety via compile-time enforcement  
- Why Rust avoids dangling references

Each section is explained with code examples and guiding comments.

## 🧠 Why Ownership Matters in Rust 

Rust doesn’t use a garbage collector. Instead, it uses ownership to manage memory efficiently and **safely at compile time**, which leads to predictable performance.

---

## 🚫 Memory Models Compared

| Approach           | ✅ Pros                          | ❌ Cons                               |
|--------------------|----------------------------------|---------------------------------------|
| Garbage Collector  | Easy memory management           | Pauses, slower runtime                |
| Manual Memory (C)  | High performance, full control   | Prone to memory bugs                  |
| Rust Ownership     | Safe, fast, no GC required       | Learning curve, strict rules          |

Rust offers manual-level speed with GC-level safety — through ownership.

## 📦 What Is Ownership?

Ownership is Rust’s way of tracking who “owns” a value in memory.

- Each value has one owner  
- Ownership moves when passed between variables or functions  
- When the owner goes out of scope, the value is **dropped** automatically

This makes memory cleanup deterministic and safe.

---

## 🧱 Stack vs Heap

- **Stack** → Fixed-size types, fast access  
- **Heap** → Dynamic types (`String`, `Vec`), more flexible  
Rust decides storage location based on type and usage.

---

## 🧹 No Garbage Collector, Still Safe

Rust prevents:

- ❌ Use-after-free  
- ❌ Double-free  
- ❌ Null pointer dereferencing  
- ❌ Data races  

✅ You get compile-time errors instead of runtime crashes.

---

## 🧨 Unsafe Code (Optional)

Rust lets you opt into unsafe blocks with `unsafe` — but only if you really need them. Most of the language remains safe and checked.

---

## 🔧 Borrowing & Mutable Access

Borrowing gives access without transferring ownership:

```rust
fn calculate_length(s: &String) -> usize {
    s.len()
}
```
&s → borrow as read-only
&mut s → borrow with permission to modify

✅ Multiple immutable borrows allowed
❌ Only one mutable borrow at a time
Rust enforces this to prevent data races.

---

## 🧾 Shadowing
You can reuse variable names by "shadowing":
```rust
let s = String::from("hello");
let (s, len) = calculate_length_bad(s); // New `s` replaces old
```
This doesn’t mutate — it replaces the variable with a new one.

---

## 🛑 Dangling References
Rust avoids returning invalid references:
```rust
fn dangle() -> &String {
    let s = String::from("oops");
    &s // ❌ compile error
}
```
Instead, return ownership:
```rust
fn valid() -> String {
    String::from("safe")
}
```
Rust forbids references to data that would be dropped.

---

### 📚 Key Examples
## 💼 Ownership Transfer
```rust
fn takes_ownership(some_string: String) {
    println!("{}", some_string); // dropped at end of scope
}
```

---

## 🌀 Cloning vs Copy
```rust
let s1 = String::from("Rust");
let s2 = s1.clone(); // Deep copy
let x = 5;
let y = x; // Copy trait
```
String must be cloned, but primitives copy by default.


---

## 🔗 Mutable Reference Example
```rust
let mut s = String::from("hello");
change(&mut s); // Function can modify s
```
Only one active mutable reference allowed at a time.

---

## 🧪 Sample Output
```
String str_orig: Rust
String str_clone: Rust is an awesome language
num_x: 5, num_y: 5
Taking ownership of: Hello
Making a copy of: 5
str_got: This is an owned string
str_back: Hello again
The length of 'hellooo' is 7
Modified str_len: hellooo - modified
The length of 'hellooo' is 7
str_ref: hellooo
Modified str_mut: hello - modified
First word: hello
First word: hello, Second word: world
Slice of the array: [1, 2]
```
