# ü¶Ä I_am_Learning_RUST

Welcome to my personal Rust study roadmap! This repository tracks my hands-on journey through Rust‚Äôs core concepts inspired by [Bogdan‚Äôs Let's Get Rusty YouTube series](https://youtube.com/LetsGetRusty) and the official *The Rust Programming Language* book.

Each folder contains annotated examples, personal notes, and progressively more advanced concepts. Think of it as my Rust journal üîç‚ú®
